"""ComfyUI node definitions for MiniMax-H3 SPEED.

Replaced Ksampler + SamplerCustomAdvanced. SPEED is only developed with euler and SamplerCustomAdvanced only supports one iteration of latent settings at a time.
TLDR: Default sampler didnt expect you to change the resolution mid flight cause why would it?

SPEED basics: denoise video as low res at low steps as no value is given from making fancy noise at high resolution.
Then we step increase resolution depending on preset and continue. 
Audio stays unchanged and done at full resolution.
